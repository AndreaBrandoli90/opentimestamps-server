Is it possible to create a https page download that saves enough header etc.
info to later prove the page contents were signed by the key? May be depending
on how the symmetric encryption is implemented.


* Calendars

BitTorrent for calendar downloads

** MerkleDag

Right now we're working towards single-instance "tips" implementation, but can
the tips be decentralized in itself? Thought experiment: take one tips
calendar, make a copy of it, update each independently. Is there a sane way to
merge the two together again? May be helpful for running distributed server
farms for instance.

* Notaries

MUST support any valid urn for identifier


Internally just put the method version into the method name:

pgp -> pgp_v1

Advantages: less going over the wire, makes searching for notaries purely a
matter of name:identity

* Security

Need to protect against people putting junk in the calendar? are we unable to
directly accept digests, need to at least hash with some random text?

We can always null it out for our purposes, but the real issue is that we'll
wind up giving other client the digests that totally different clients
submitted.


* File formats

Record each digest a timestamp applies to in the timestamp file itself. Unit test.
