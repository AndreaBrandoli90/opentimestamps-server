NTP can be used in authenticated mode, however that puts load on the central,
secure server, because each client has a separate session secured by symmetric
crypto.

However, if the client uses a nonce, and has that nonce timestamped, the nonce
can travel up progressive levels of merkle trees to one or more central
servers. The client then checks that timestamp and knows what time it is.
rfc3161 is a good candidate for the actual signatures, because it leveraging
the ssl certificate authorities in a simple to validate way.
